# Candidate logos and hex stickers

## Logos

The logo options included here are extremely minor modifications of the
[current
logo](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/_static/arrow.png):
the word “Apache” is written in normal-weight Roboto font (available
under an Apache licence) and the word “Arrow” is written in boldfaced
Barlow font (available under the SIL Open Font Licence). Both fonts are
accessible through Google fonts. The differences between the existing
version and the proposed ones are:

-   source code to generate the logos is provided
-   light themed and dark themed images are provided
-   transparent and opaque background images are provided
-   png and svg versions are provided

Why is this useful?

-   easier to modify in the future
-   allows creation of Apache Arrow branding guidelines similar to [ASF
    guidelines](https://apache.org/foundation/press/kit/ApacheFoundation_StyleGuide.pdf)
    or [R-Ladies](https://github.com/rladies/branding-materials)
-   fixes the problem where social media previews for blog posts display
    incorrectly when the user has dark mode set!

In essence, it’s just a slightly more complete version of the existing
logotype with a little more documentation. Anyway, here’s what the light
and dark themed versions look like

handy to have a version with the URL:

## Hex stickers

Now the fun part! Here are three possibilities that use the existing
logo in an essentially unmodified format.

![](hexes/arrow-hex_03.png)

I’m not very enthusiastic about any of these because the text will be
very difficult to read when printed at typical hex sticker size. Here
are two vertically oriented versions that I think work better:

![](hexes/arrow-hex_04.png) ![](hexes/arrow-hex_05.png)

Some fine tuning would certainly be worthwhile, but after comparing
these images to other hex stickers that I happen to have both on my
laptop and as image files, I’d suggest that the “arrow.apache.org” text
in these final two is the lower bound on the font size for any text that
we want to include
